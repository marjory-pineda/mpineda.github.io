## Project Overview

This study explores the everyday experiences, strategies, and accessibility practices of **assembly line garment workers with visual impairments** at *Blind Industries and Services of Maryland (BISM)*.  
Through on-site observations and interviews, the project highlights how individuals with limited or no vision successfully perform intricate sewing and garment-construction tasks in a fast-paced, mixed-ability environment. The research draws attention to **low-tech accessibility solutions**, **blind-perspective training**, and the collaborative methods that make inclusive manufacturing possible.

## Methods

- **Observations**: Three sessions were held across different times of day to capture workflow dynamics, teamwork, and communication patterns among 10–30 workers.  
- **Interviews**: Four participants—including blind associates, a trainer, and a manager—were interviewed to explore training methods, accessibility modifications, and coordination practices.  
Data were analyzed deductively, guided by themes identified from observations (e.g., *training methods*, *accessibility solutions*, *collaboration*). The focus was on how garment assembly tasks (e.g., sewing military uniforms) are adapted through tactile cues, custom machine guides, and non-visual training techniques.

## Findings

### Work Environment and Collaboration
The assembly line included both sighted and blind associates working in parallel sections of garment construction.  
Workers relied on **tactile positioning systems**, consistent hand-offs, and well-coordinated communication to maintain workflow.  
Participants described a strong sense of **teamwork and mutual respect**, with one noting, *“We are all here for the same reason; we help each other out—it’s like a family here.”

### Training and Education
New associates received hands-on, **non-visual training**, often conducted by blind trainers using **hand-over-hand** or **hand-under-hand** methods.  
All trainees, regardless of vision, practiced sewing while blindfolded to develop tactile awareness and control.  
This “**blind-perspective training**” emphasized learning through touch, building confidence, and ensuring that new associates could complete tasks safely and independently.

### Low-Tech Accessibility Innovations
Workers and trainers collaboratively created **low-tech accessibility modifications** to support workflow, such as:
- **Tactile sewing guides** made from Dymo tape, magnets, or 3D-printed strips  
- **Notched fabric edges** to align material without relying on sight  
These DIY solutions were **affordable, customizable, and easy to iterate**, embodying inclusive, participatory design principles within an industrial setting.

## Impact and Discussion

This research challenges traditional assumptions about vision-dependent labor and demonstrates how **inclusive design and collaborative adaptation** can reshape the future of manufacturing.  

Key contributions include:
- Recognizing **low-tech innovation** as a scalable accessibility solution in production environments.  
- Documenting **blind-perspective training** as an effective framework for skill-building and empowerment.  
- Highlighting how organizations can foster **mixed-ability collaboration** and redefine workplace accessibility as a collective responsibility.

The findings have implications beyond manufacturing, offering insights for **inclusive training design**, **accessible technology development**, and **policy guidance** under frameworks like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
